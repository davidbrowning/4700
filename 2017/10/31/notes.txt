__User Defined types__

** Tests back on thursday **

does lang allow user defined types. 

well defined, and well understood objects THAT FIT IN YOUR DOMAIN
 -- good idea

First/Second class citizens. 

First: You can do everything with the thing you defined that you could in a native type (c++)
Second: You can't do everything with the thing you defined that you could in a native type (c++)

Tools provided for encapsulation/abstraction (e.g. public/private, objects)

User defined type constructors (take type return type). 
   -- type*

 vector is a type constructor.
 Critical for generic programming style
  benefits: pattern matchine or duck typing

Expression:
 Means of expressing computation
 Combination of values and operators that has a value

 peano addition. 

Operator Overloading
 can it be done?
 langage overload operators
 how does this affect the language
 
 associator 
  commutative, distributive, closed under itself
  form a ring.
 
 if assumtions are met regarding operators, code is clearer
 if not, code is less clear

Side Effects
  An observable change of global state
  - output parameters
  - global variables
  - class variables
  - IO

Referential transparency
 Expression w/no side effects: you see its value
 Functions are called pure if they have this property
 Four major causes of impurity
 - Error
 - Non-determinism
 - Context
 - Destruction (output)

Short-Circuit Evaluation
 Value can be and is determined w/o evaluation the whole expression it is called short-circuit

 0 *(and) X = 0
 1 +(or) X = 1

Also possible with memoized pure functions
