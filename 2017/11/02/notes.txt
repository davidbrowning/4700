Assignment

Procedural Languages- Write to memory, always a side effect
Functional and Logic = Create a new name binding to a constant value
  "Let blah = expression"

Ambiguous CFG: more than one parse tree to an expression.

Type Conversions

narrowing: target type cannot exactly represent all instances of the source type.
widening: !narrow (destination type can accept all values) 
 8 to 32 bit int is widening
 32 to 8 bit int is narrowing (narrowing: might lose data)
casting: way to express conversion
 if widening: okay
 if narrowing: could be problematic. 
Q's for lang:
 does it allow casting? if so, does it allow narrowing/widening
 does it allow mixed mode expression 3.0 + 1

Red/Black Trees
 Null: black
 Root: always black
 Red Child: always has black parent
 Node is either red or black. 
 Every path from root to leaf has the same number of black nodes.
