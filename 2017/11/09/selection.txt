selection shit.
Multiple selection:

std::map<string, function<uuid(uuid)>>  #this is the command pattern in c++

Jump Table:
 A[index] = address

 goto A[switch];


Iteration
 Used for repetition
  <procedural languages only>
   How to control iteration?
   Where does structure appear?
  Counter controlled loop
   loop var
   begin; end; step
   For
   For Each

  Iterators are associated with containers and 
   know how to traverse containers. *Elements of Programming: 

Logically Controlled Loop
 Has a condition
  test before or after?
  while(e)
  do ... while(e)

User located loop exits(break, last, final...)
Skip statement
 continue
Used to eliminate some usese of goto

Dijkstra's 1968 seminal paper (goto considered harmful)

Human -> Static Program -> machine -> dynamic process
